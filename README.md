# Power BI Data Generator

This repository contains two Python applications:

1. **Hotel.py**: This script generates random sales data for a hotel, including:
    - Number of attendees
    - Rooms
    - Costings
    - Cancellations
    - Breakfast or dinner orders

2. **Employee.py**: This script generates a CSV file with fake company data for employees, including:
    - Departments
    - Salaries
    - Ages

Both scripts use Python and can be run with the standard Python libraries by executing the following command:

```sh
python {filename}.py
```
